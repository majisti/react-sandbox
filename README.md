React Sandbox
=============

A tiny (and visually ugly) project that will allow you
to quickly get working on a React toy project. Everything
is setup for you to simply clone this and run it.

It will show a list of cards with dummy news data within them.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/majisti/react-sandbox.git
cd react-sandbox
sh bin/install.sh
sh bin/cra.sh start
```

## How to use this project
You can use this project to simply fool around and try to
clean it up, add features, add interaction or simply test
some bit of code you found online.

An idea of what a next step could look like would be:
- Load data from a server
- Add a loading state to the cards while data is being loaded
- Allow the user to expand the card to read the whole article
- Use a UI framework to ease styling the app
  - Material-UI, Semantic-UI-React, office-ui-fabric-react, etc
